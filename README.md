## Multirotor vertical wind shear measuring script
**Written in Python, based on Dronekit.**

Measures multirotor's attitude, current position and groundspeed, and by 
knowing its aerodynamic characteristics, converts measurements to 
wind speed and direction.

*Tested on Ardupilot's SITL simulator, 
*on which all transformations are also based.
